This charter places you in charge of some portion of this conquered territory (or land abandoned by the defeated enemy) and commands you to hold and pacify it in the name of your patron. The people are particularly devoted and supportive of your rule (if partially out of fear), but the constant threat of potential war hinders the arts and makes it difficult for citizens to truly relax. If you opt for this charter, you are asked to set up your kingdom against Pitax"

If you select this charter, Lady Jamandi expects you to remain strong allies with Restov."

In this case, Lady Jamandi applauds your bravery and self-confidence, but warns that establishing a kingdom is no small task. An open charter grants a single ability boost to any ability score, and the new nation has no built-in ability flaw."

While the type of magic wielded by the nation's rulers can adjust its themes (or even its name—a thaumocracy run by divine spellcasters would be a theocracy, for example), the details below remain the same whether it's arcane, divine, occult, primal, or any combination of the four.
