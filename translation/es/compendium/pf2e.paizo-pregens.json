Si no hubiera sido por una feroz manada de chacales que lo arrinconaron en un callejón una noche, el frágil elfo nunca habría descubierto su verdadero potencial. En ese momento, cuando las bestias gruñentes se acercaron para matar, la magia en su sangre cobró vida y casi las ahogó en un torrente aparentemente interminable deagua. </p>\n <p> Poco después, Elsir solía utilizar sus nuevos dones para ganar monedas. Al principio hacía trucos en las esquinas, pero poco después se mudó a las tabernas. A medida que crecía su talento con la magia, también crecía su habilidad con el engaño y la astucia. Después de todo, ¿quién en su sano juicio se conformaría con unas pocas monedas como propina cuando uno podría robarle un bolso entero a un cliente distraído por un hechizo mágico? Como era de esperar, poco después se vio buscado por la ley y huyó de Osirion apenas seis años después.meses después.

Cada vez que la tripulación del Bird llegaba a puerto, él trabajaba en su oficio, ganaba algo de dinero extramoneda, y desapareció antes de que alguien sospechara siquiera de él. Mientras tanto, a bordo del barco, su talento para la magia acuática lo hacía invaluable para la tripulación. Y el capitán encontraba deseable su ojo para los objetos de valor y los objetos mágicos cada vez que la tripulación adquiría nuevos tesoros. </p>\n <p> Desafortunadamente, esto también llegó a su fin. Después de que el Brass Bird abordó un barco mercante varisiano, la bruja a bordo maldijo el barco del Capitán Renlock. A partir de ese día, la suerte de la tripulación cambió. elsir estaba allícuando sucedió, y no puede evitar sentir que la maldición estaba dirigida específicamente a él. Los mares se volvieron contra el Brass Bird y poco después la armada andorana persiguió implacablemente al barco. Después de una batalla campal, el Capitán Renlock se rindió y Elsir finalmente vio el interior de una celda de prisión. Liberado sólo unos meses después, Elsir regresó a Absalom, dejando atrás el mar para siempre (o eso pensaba). </p>\n <p> Allí, en la enorme metrópolis, Elsir se instaló comoproveedor de baratijas y hechizos mágicos, que utiliza sus talentos para crear falsificaciones o hacer pasar pequeñas chucherías por poderosas reliquias. Cada vez que los lugareños sospechaban que había cometido un delito, simplemente hacía las maletas y se trasladaba a un nuevo distrito. Con una ciudad tan grande como Absalón, tenía muchos lugares a donde ir, evitando sospechas durante más de cinco años. Pero la maldición de la vieja bruja aún no había terminado con él, y después de que un cliente llegó con un anillo maldito real, Elsir se encontró atado a esa cosa repugnante. Gracias aLa maldición del anillo, su cuerpo se ha ido consumiendo lentamente con el tiempo. </p>\n <p> Peor aún, acaba de recibir la noticia de que el Capitán Renlock falleció en prisión. El viejo capitán y su extraño pájaro mecánico siempre fueron amables con Elsir, y la pérdida lo ha golpeado duramente... </p>\n <p> <strong> Objetivos </strong> En primer lugar, Elsir quiere encontrar la moneda necesaria para un poderoso lanzamiento de eliminación de la maldición, para liberarse del anillo que drena su vitalidad. aunque el lo haríaNunca lo admitas, Elsir está cansado de su vida actual.

Sin embargo, le cuesta imaginar un mundo en el que alguien realmente lo aceptara de esa manera. </p>\n <p> <strong> Personalidad </strong> Elsir a menudo se muestra amargado y hastiado.

Dirigió una pandilla de niños que pronto se convirtió en un gremio de carteristas y ladrones menores. Años más tarde, una redada realizada por las fuerzas del orden detuvo a la mitad de su pandilla y Jadren estaba seguro de que sus compañeros de gremio lo señalarían como el cabecilla. Huyó de la ciudad esa noche, dejando atrás el único lugar al que alguna vez había llamado hogar. Durante meses deambulóde puerto en puerto, bebiendo y divirtiéndose hasta que despertó una mañana después de haber firmado con la tripulación pirata del Brass Bird. </p>\n <p> Al principio, no había demostrado ninguna habilidad para navegar, pero a medida que pasaron los años, aprendió casi todos los roles a bordo de un barco, desde cocinero hasta contramaestre. Jadren a menudo era el alma de todas las fiestas, contando historias extravagantes y ridículas de su juventud. Como resultado, el Capitán Renlock le tomó simpatía. Pasaron varios años buenos y elEl capitán ascendió a Jadren a primer oficial. Justo después de la promoción, todo salió mal. </p>\n <p> Después de perseguir un barco mercante varisiano, la tripulación abordó el barco en busca de botín. Tomando todo el cargamento que pudieron encontrar, el capitán accedió a dejar ir a la tripulación y al barco, pero una bruja varisiana a bordo se ofendió por el robo y maldijo al Pájaro de Bronce y su tripulación. Ni dos días después, el barco se vio acosado por tormentas y fuertes vientos. Una semana después de eso, la marina andorana finalmente rastreóel pájaro abajo. Durante días, la tripulación de Jadren navegó hacia el sur, intentando regresar a Los Grilletes. Sin embargo, la armada andorana no cejó en su persecución. El Capitán Renlock intentó desesperadamente devolver el Brass Bird a su puerto secreto en una pequeña isla justo al norte de la nación pirata, pero los vientos estaban en su contra. </p>\n <p> Después de una batalla campal en la que Jadren resultó gravemente herido, el Capitán Renlock se rindió. Y así, terminó el primer acto de la vida de Jadren. despertandoen el templo de Iomedae en Andoran fue lo primero que recordó después de la batalla. El sacerdote aquí atendió las heridas de Jadren y ayudó a arreglar sus huesos. Fue una recuperación larga, una que los sacerdotes querían que él hiciera por su cuenta, sin la ayuda de la magia, para que pudiera ver el costo total de la vida que había elegido. Después de semanas de curación, los sacerdotes le dieron una opción. Podría ir a prisión durante varios meses para cumplir su condena, o podría quedarse con ellos y ayudar a cuidar el templo y servir.los pobres como penitencia. </p>\n <p> Como eso sonaba mejor que una celda de prisión, Jadren estuvo de acuerdo. Durante los siguientes meses, Jadren aprendió mucho sobre sí mismo y consideró cuidadosamente su pasado. Había vivido una vida de avaricia, pensando sólo en sí mismo y en su propio placer. Al ayudar a los demás, los sacerdotes le mostraron el valor de una vida de servicio y humildad. También le enseñaron disciplina y lo entrenaron en habilidades marciales. Las enseñanzas de estos sacerdotes también persuadieron a Jadren de que darOrientar la vida hacia un bien mayor podría proporcionar un sentido más fuerte de propósito. </p>\n <p> Cuando llegó el momento de irse, Jadren pidió quedarse y comenzó a entrenar para convertirse en un campeón de la fe. Ahora, varios años después, Jadren se ha convertido en un hombre diferente. Es un guerrero acérrimo dedicado a Iomedae, dispuesto a dar su vida al servicio de los demás. Está especialmente interesado en ayudar a aquellos que han elegido una vida delictiva a ver el error en sus caminos como él lo ha hecho.Desafortunadamente, se da cuenta de que es demasiado tarde para su anterior amigo y mentor, el Capitán Renlock. El famoso loro mecánico del capitán, Cawlo, llegó al templo ayer mismo para informar a Jadren de su fallecimiento. Y Cawlo llegó con una petición críptica... </p>\n <p> <strong> Metas </strong> Jadren busca expiar el daño que causó durante su vida anterior. Nada le gustaría más que cambiar su pasado, a pesar de que esto probablemente sea imposible.Aunque sabe que tal vez nunca se redima, se concentra en tomar medidas que cree que pueden mejorar el mundo. </p>\n <p> <strong> Personalidad: </strong> Jadren es cálido y amigable, casi hasta el extremo. Si bien su comportamiento alguna vez estuvo acompañado de humor obsceno y brindis entusiastas, ahora suele ser parte de un sermón o parábola sobre Iomedae. Quienes lo conocen ahora no pueden imaginar la vida que llevaba antes. Asimismo, aquellos de una vida pasada se sorprenderían al verlo hoy.</p>\n <p> <strong> Relaciones </strong> Aquellos de la fe aprecian profundamente a Jadren y su dedicación a las enseñanzas de Iomedae. Para los de afuera, puede parecer sermoneador y moralista. </p>",

Nacida bajo un signo auspicioso, los padres de Kaako la declararon una devoradora de maldiciones, alguien que podría consumir la mala suerte que caía sobre la tripulación y traerles buena suerte. Como era de esperar, a la tripulación le gustaron instantáneamente sus traviesas travesuras. Al crecer a bordo de un barco, Kaako pasó sus años de formación conociendo a todo tipo de gente del resto del mundo, navegando por las costas de Avistan yGarund. Fueron buenos años y los recuerda con cariño y nostalgia. </p>\n <p> Años más tarde, Kaako dejó a sus padres para unirse a la tripulación del Capitán Renlock a bordo del Brass Bird. Durante algún tiempo permaneció feliz allí. La tripulación del Brass Bird se hizo un nombre como piratas a bordo de uno de los barcos más temidos que navegan por las costas. Cuando el Pájaro alcanzó un pequeño barco mercante frente a la costa de Varisia, Kaako se encontró con un maleficio que ni siquiera ella pudo evitar.Al no tener ningún deseo de tomar el barco ni los rehenes, la tripulación del Bird asaltó el barco en busca de objetos de valor antes de liberarlo. Un pasajero, una bruja varisia, se ofendió por el robo y lanzó una maldición sobre el Bird y su tripulación. Después de aquel fatídico día, el barco se vio continuamente acosado por tormentas y malos vientos. El Brass Bird constantemente chocaba con patrullas de varias armadas listas para detener el barco. Todo esto desembocó en el fatídico encuentro con la armada andorana. Perseguido de regreso a los Grilletes, el LatónBird y su tripulación finalmente fueron vencidos. Queriendo no más derramamiento de sangre, el Capitán Renlock se rindió y la tripulación del Brass Bird se dispersó. </p>\n <p> Afortunadamente, Kaako fue liberada sólo unos meses después y volvió a vivir en mar abierto. Aunque se unió a tripulaciones a bordo de otros barcos, Kaako nunca volvió a encontrar un hogar. Cinco años después, Kaako todavía disfruta de la vida de pirata, pero se cansa de llenar los bolsillos de otras personas con oro y dejar poco para ella. EntoncesLlegó la noticia de que el Capitán Renlock había fallecido en prisión. Y su misterioso loro mecánico, Cawlo, llegó a la ventana de la cabaña de Kaako para entregar un mensaje... </p>\n <p> <strong> Metas </strong> Kaako sueña con un futuro en el que pueda capitanear su propio barco o al menos encontrar una tripulación a la que pueda llamar familia. La vida en alta mar puede ser agotadora, especialmente cuando hay poco que mostrar después de años de trabajo. </p>\n <p> <strong> Personalidad</strong> Kaako es curiosa, pero se asusta rápidamente. Tiene predilección por vestirse de manera extravagante, adornándose con baratijas y adornos brillantes que, según ella, la ayudan a protegerse de los malos espíritus y las maldiciones. En realidad, a ella simplemente le gusta el aspecto de estos accesorios. Kaako no está por encima de jugar con su conexión \"mística\", a pesar de no tener mucho control sobre esos asuntos. Sin embargo, entre amigos es mucho más relajada y puede ser bromista. </p>\n <p> <strong>Relaciones </strong> La mayoría ve a Kaako como una persona extraña y misteriosa que tiene muchos secretos. Como resultado, pocos intentan acercarse a ella. Aquellos que llegan a conocer a la joven tengu descubren que ella puede ser una amiga cariñosa, aunque tiende a ser un poco incómoda con otros humanoides. </p>",

Lavanna, vendida por sus amos chelaxianos a un capitán mercante a una edad muy temprana, pronto encontró la libertad en aguas abiertas, ascendiendo en las filas del Silver Dancer, el primer barco en el que sirvió como miembro de la tripulación. Una noche, durante una tormenta particularmente temible, Lavanna quedó atrapada en cubierta, pero en lugar de ser arrojada o arrastrada por la borda, la joven halfling encontró paz en los vientos arremolinados y sintió gracia en elolas punzantes bañándola. Esta fue la primera vez que escuchó la voz de Gozreh y descubrió que tenía sangre de ondina en las venas. </p>\n <p> El entrenamiento de Lavanna fue todo menos tradicional. Aprendió lo que pudo sobre la fe de Gozreh en cada puerto de escala, mientras mantenía sus deberes a bordo del barco mercante. Con el tiempo, se volvió bastante exitosa y asumió el cargo de sanadora de Silver Dancer. Un año más tarde, sus habilidades se pusieron a prueba cuando unSe produjo un terrible incendio a bordo y el barco comenzó a hundirse. Fue sólo gracias a la habilidad de Lavanna que alguno de los miembros de la tripulación sobrevivió a esa catástrofe. Afortunadamente, su barco fue descubierto por el Brass Bird, un barco pirata de cierto renombre. El Capitán Renlock se apiadó de las pobres almas del Silver Dancer, se hizo cargo de ellos y los dejó en el puerto más cercano. </p>\n <p> Lavanna decidió quedarse a bordo del Brass Bird, ayudando a ministrar a la tripulación y garantizar que el barco navegara conLa gracia de Gozreh. Aunque nunca tuvo mucho estómago para la piratería, Lavanna se dedicó a la vida a bordo del Bird y descubrió que tenía mucho en común con la variada tripulación. Todos marginados y vagabundos, se forjaron vidas según su propia elección. Por un tiempo, eso fue suficiente. El Brass Bird tuvo problemas cuando su tripulación abordó un pequeño barco mercante frente a la costa de Varisia. Después de tomar los objetos de valor del barco, el Capitán Renlock dejó ir a la tripulación. Sin embargo, una bruja varisia se ofendió por el robo y puso unamaldición sobre el Pájaro y su tripulación. Terribles tormentas acosaron al Bird y su tripulación. Ninguna cantidad de oraciones a Gozreh podría calmar los mares. Peor aún, la armada andorana se enteró del rastro del Bird y persiguió al barco en cada esquina. </p>\n <p> Después de una batalla campal, el Capitán Renlock entregó el barco y la pequeña familia que Lavanna había llegado a apreciar quedó destrozada. Afortunadamente, la mediana pronto recuperó su libertad después de sólo unos meses en prisión. Dirigiéndose haciaAl llegar al puerto, se encontró con su antiguo capitán a quien ayudó a rescatar hace tantos años. No dos días después zarpó de nuevo, esta vez en el Silver Dancer II. Los últimos cinco años han sido mayoritariamente pacíficos y prósperos. Lavanna se ha vuelto cómoda y con esa comodidad ha llegado la duda. Si bien atender a la tripulación es un trabajo importante, a veces se pregunta si la comodidad y la rutina que disfruta a bordo del barco se alinean con los principios de su deidad. </p>\n <p> Tales pensamientos tendránSin embargo, tendrá que esperar, ya que le ha llegado la noticia de que el Capitán Renlock ha fallecido en prisión. Curiosamente, la noticia la dio su curioso loro mecánico, Cawlo... </p>\n <p> <strong> Metas </strong> Lavanna se encuentra en una encrucijada y debe decidir si abandonar o no su estilo de vida fácil. Su pasión por los viajes crece día a día y pronto podría abrumarla.

Anhela el océano abierto, desafiar el mar y las tormentas, navegando hacia lo desconocido para ver toda la generosidad de la naturaleza. Desafortunadamente, años de trabajo en un barco mercante la han vuelto suave y complaciente. La tripulación del Silver Dancer II tiende a ir a lo seguro, permaneciendo en la orilla durante condiciones climáticas peligrosas y viajando por rutas prohibidas. Aunque Lavanna consideraAunque es importante atender a la tripulación, a menudo se aburre por la falta de peligro en su rutina. </p>\n <p> Lavanna también sigue fascinada por la naturaleza, pero en particular por el océano y las criaturas que lo habitan. A veces puede estar callada, pero cuando se trata de hablar sobre el mar, la mayoría descubre que no pueden decir una palabra entre sus frenéticos peroratas. </p>\n <p> <strong> Relaciones </strong> Lavanna solía tener una racha un poco salvaje,sumergiéndose profundamente en el grog y cantando canciones marineras con el resto de la tripulación.

They are ingenious crafters and devoted allies within their warrens, but those who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers, especially when they have the backing of a draconic sorcerer or true dragon overlord. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kobolds are resourceful survivors whose snare-guarded warrens and opportunistic scavenging have cast them as villains to most other humanoids, with their draconic reverence lending them a reputation as mere minions and nuisances. Yet some kobolds have emerged from their secluded warrens seeking the relative safety of surface settlements, the lucrative prospects of the adventuring life, or validating awe from followers of their own.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with oversized confidence, deadly cunning, and the ancient power of dragons flowing through their veins, you should play a kobold.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take pride in your draconic connections, whether you believe dragons are your ancestors or simply patrons.</li>\n<li>Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.</li>\n<li>Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger.</li>\n<li>Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses.</li>\n<li>Consider your claims of draconic power to be overblown, delusional, or endearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall) reptilian humanoids with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth, or—more rarely—vestigial wings or draconic breath. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and living to about 60.</p>\n<p>The color of a kobold's scales can vary widely. Most often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched kobolds often reflect the community's draconic exemplar, whether that's the dragon they currently serve or the dragon type from which they're descended.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable patron (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). They often achieve an unshakable fervor and loyalty to their new cause or leader. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.</p>\n<p>Whether led by a dragon or not, kobolds almost always identify themselves with a type of dragon that serves as their spiritual exemplar. Their societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by the exemplar's personality.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural respect for hierarchies and rules, and so kobolds are rarely chaotic. Kobold adventurers tend to be lawful neutral or neutral, relying on their ancestral social strategies for survival.</p>\n<p>Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds, especially when a deity assumes a commanding or tyrannical disposition. Many gravitate toward Abadar's order or Shelyn's artistic flair. More sinister communities uphold Asmodeus and other archdevils as common patrons. The dragon deities Apsu and Dahak are also common subjects of worship. Kobolds also often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with dragons or devils as figureheads.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Kobolds often adventure in pursuit of the power, lore, and treasure that they feel befit their disproportionately large egos. When adventurers, militias, or careless tyrants shatter a kobold community, the survivors often latch onto new families, seeking emotional solace—and sometimes revenge. Typical kobold backgrounds include artisan, artist, criminal, hunter, miner, scout, and tinker, plus bandit, cultist, scavenger, and servant. Kobolds excel as bards, rangers, rogues, and sorcerers, though they also often channel their ingenuity as alchemists or wizards.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>PFS Note</strong> Due to years of successful Pathfinder Society activities, all characters have access to the kobold ancestry.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Kobold Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Draconic</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, and so they do not depend upon these druids for care, though</p>\n<p>Not all leshies have a strong enough spirit to strike off completely on their own, however. Weaker nature spirits can form only tenuous bonds that are just strong enough to animate Tiny bodies. These spirits become leshy familiars, acting as companions to their druid creators. Independent leshies are often protective of such leshy familiars, advocating for them to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Act as a traveling agent for natural guardians who are unable to leave their territories.</li>\n<li>Encourage civilizations you encounter to cooperate with nature and build their cities in ecologically friendly ways.</li>\n<li>Become attached to new friends you make on your journeys.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think of you as a curiosity due to your spiritual origins.</li>\n<li>Judge you by your looks, treating you sweetly if you are cute or reacting with horror if you are frightening.</li>\n<li>Assume you know only about nature and are unfamiliar with civilization and society.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Leshies are as varied as the material used to create their vessels, usually appearing as a bizarre mishmash of various plants or fungi. Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Due to the nature of the ritual used to create a leshy, leshies begin their lives as adults. As spirits, they do not age, and a leshy could potentially remain in the same vessel forever—though leshies rarely consider this outcome to be desirable.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Though guardian leshies often congregate, traveling leshies are not naturally drawn to others of their own kind. To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. A betrayed leshy might not directly attack those who slight them, but they might withdraw support at a critical moment or leave their betrayers to get lost in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though those familiar with leshies know that this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies often take pride in their own appearances and appreciate beauty of all kinds in others, but they rarely form judgments based on physical appearance. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Leshies tend to gravitate toward plant bodies that match their genders. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>A leshy can be of any alignment, depending on what spirit inhabits their body, but their outlook often includes a neutral element. Religion is not particularly significant to most leshies. Those with a philosophical bent lean toward the Green Faith, and Gozreh is the most popular deity among faithful leshies. Some leshies also venerate green men, powerful spirits of nature that act as regional guardians.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Some backgrounds are particularly suitable for adventuring leshies, especially those backgrounds with a tie to the natural world, such as hunter, nomad, or scout. Nature-themed classes such as druid and ranger are popular choices for leshies. As druids, leshies gravitate toward the leaf order. Bard is also a good fit for leshies with a love of storytelling; such leshies often inhabit vine leshy bodies.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Leshies choose and change their names multiple times throughout their lives. These names often represent a facet of their personalities or values, though another common naming convention is to use descriptions of a natural feature they admire. Some leshies even use a cycle of names that changes to align with natural phenomena, such as names based upon the season or the time of day.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Scarlet in Summer, Verdant Taleweaver, Lurking Hunter, Masterful Sun Drinker, Noon Sky Evening Song, Snowy Pine Branch, Cascading Rapids</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Leshy Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Sylvan</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "description": "<p><em>Guardians and emissaries of the environment, leshies are immortal spirits of nature temporarily granted a physical form.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Leshies are 'born' when a skilled druid or other master of primal magic conducts a ritual to create a suitable vessel, and then a spirit chooses that vessel to be their temporary home. Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, and so they do not depend upon these druids for care, though</p>\n<p>Not all leshies have a strong enough spirit to strike off completely on their own, however. Weaker nature spirits can form only tenuous bonds that are just strong enough to animate Tiny bodies. These spirits become leshy familiars, acting as companions to their druid creators. Independent leshies are often protective of such leshy familiars, advocating for them to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Act as a traveling agent for natural guardians who are unable to leave their territories.</li>\n<li>Encourage civilizations you encounter to cooperate with nature and build their cities in ecologically friendly ways.</li>\n<li>Become attached to new friends you make on your journeys.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think of you as a curiosity due to your spiritual origins.</li>\n<li>Judge you by your looks, treating you sweetly if you are cute or reacting with horror if you are frightening.</li>\n<li>Assume you know only about nature and are unfamiliar with civilization and society.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Leshies are as varied as the material used to create their vessels, usually appearing as a bizarre mishmash of various plants or fungi. Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Due to the nature of the ritual used to create a leshy, leshies begin their lives as adults. As spirits, they do not age, and a leshy could potentially remain in the same vessel forever—though leshies rarely consider this outcome to be desirable.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Though guardian leshies often congregate, traveling leshies are not naturally drawn to others of their own kind. To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. A betrayed leshy might not directly attack those who slight them, but they might withdraw support at a critical moment or leave their betrayers to get lost in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though those familiar with leshies know that this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies often take pride in their own appearances and appreciate beauty of all kinds in others, but they rarely form judgments based on physical appearance. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Leshies tend to gravitate toward plant bodies that match their genders. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>A leshy can be of any alignment, depending on what spirit inhabits their body, but their outlook often includes a neutral element. Religion is not particularly significant to most leshies. Those with a philosophical bent lean toward the Green Faith, and Gozreh is the most popular deity among faithful leshies. Some leshies also venerate green men, powerful spirits of nature that act as regional guardians.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Some backgrounds are particularly suitable for adventuring leshies, especially those backgrounds with a tie to the natural world, such as hunter, nomad, or scout. Nature-themed classes such as druid and ranger are popular choices for leshies. As druids, leshies gravitate toward the leaf order. Bard is also a good fit for leshies with a love of storytelling; such leshies often inhabit vine leshy bodies.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Leshies choose and change their names multiple times throughout their lives. These names often represent a facet of their personalities or values, though another common naming convention is to use descriptions of a natural feature they admire. Some leshies even use a cycle of names that changes to align with natural phenomena, such as names based upon the season or the time of day.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Scarlet in Summer, Verdant Taleweaver, Lurking Hunter, Masterful Sun Drinker, Noon Sky Evening Song, Snowy Pine Branch, Cascading Rapids</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Leshy Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Sylvan</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Un día, mientras excavaba los restos enterrados de una casa, Rhin logró recuperar un libro infantil prácticamente intacto. Intrigado por las coloridas imágenes, Rhin separó con cuidado las páginas para investigar su nuevo hallazgo. Aunque el libro estaba escrito en un idioma que él no entendía y la escritura estaba prácticamente arruinada, las ilustracionespintó una historia clara: Rhin quedó fascinado con la historia de un niño humano con un anillo mágico que emprendió atrevidas aventuras y podía llamar a un dragón del mar con una melodía especial. </span> </p>\n <p> Convencido de que se trataba de una especie de libro de historia, Rhin ha hecho todo lo posible para emular a este misterioso héroe. </span> </p>\n <p> Escatimó monedas y recogió retales de tela para coser un traje que hacía juego con el niño del cuento. Un anillo de cobre, deslustrado hasta volverse verde,adorna uno de sus dedos. De manera algo más práctica, Rhin se sometió a un curso intensivo de artes marciales, emulando las posturas y maniobras que realizaba el niño; si bien este no fue el mejor de los maestros, también demostró estar lejos de ser el peor. Sin embargo, lo más sorprendente para los otros kobolds Hookclaw fue la música de Rhin. Cada vez que Rhin toca un determinado conjunto de melodías, la magia parece responder. </span> </p>\n <p> Rhin cree firmemente que su poder proviene de unDragón dormido en el puerto de Absalom que escucha su ocarina en sus sueños y le envía su poder a cambio. Los otros Hookclaws se muestran escépticos, pero nadie puede contener la respiración el tiempo suficiente para demostrar que Rhin está equivocado. Sus canciones son claramente efectivas, y los siempre pragmáticos kobolds creen que es muy probable que sus poderes provengan de un dragón hundido. El propio Rhin está siempre buscando nueva música e inspiración, convencido de que si puede tocar la melodía correcta, su dragón despertará y se elevará hastareunirse con él. </span> </p>",

The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits.</p>\n<p>The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.</p>\n<p>Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.</p>\n<p>Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells-you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures concealed from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as true strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, remove curse and similar spells don't affect your curse at all.</p>"

The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell. When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory).</p>"

But Tlehar never despaired, for the dawn must forever represent hope to all good people who gaze upon it. She holds the Bright Lions of Mzali especially dear in her heart, since they were a ray of hope to her people even when she couldn't be. Thanks to them, citizens of Mzali and beyond have been reminded of her loving embrace, and once again awaken with resolve in their hearts.</p>\n<p>Tlehar keeps watch over every birth and new beginning, as there is no greater symbol of hope than new life. Midwives and nurses pray to Tlehar to keep watch over their work and ensure the health of newborns. Those coming to terms with a new gender or sexuality may call on Tlehar's blessing and protection as they learn to better understand themselves. People fleeing from unsafe homes can seek out her followers for safe refuge; these followers of Tlehar wear discrete, iron charms to let others know that they will be ready to fight for them. No matter their needs, Tlehar represents a sanctuary of peace in a sea of fear. It is her hope that the people of Mzali will soon live in fear no longer.</p>\n<p>The dawn goddess is depicted as a human woman with golden skin, the gray-furred head of a lioness, and eyes as black as night. She is often portrayed on Chohar's left side, opposite her sister, with one hand extended in welcome and the other holding an iron morningstar. While Tlehar is not typically as strict in her justice as her counterparts, she shows no mercy to those who hurt the ones they claim to love. She may be willing to forgive those who offer sincere repentance, but the lioness of the dawn has a will of iron. She believes that sometimes, protecting the hope of a better tomorrow means destroying those who cast darkness over the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> give yourself fully to everything you attempt, always maintain hope that tomorrow will be a better day, treasure every gift you are given by those who matter to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> lose your motivation to your regrets, spread despair, treat a loved one poorly</p>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.ckUOoqOM7Kg7VqxB]{Avatar} spell, a worshipper of Tlehar gains the following additional abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Tlehar</strong> Speed 50 feet, Fly speed 70 feet, cannot be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}</p>\n<p>Melee <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> morningstar (versatile piercing, reach 15 feet), Damage [[/r (6d6+6)[bludgeoning]]]</p>\n<p>Ranged <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> morning light (range increment 120 feet), Damage [[/r (3d6+3)[fire],(3d6+3)[vitality]]]{3d6+3 fire and 3d6+3 vitality}</p>"

You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots.
